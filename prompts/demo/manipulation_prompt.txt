1. I give you a list of objects you can pick:
['purple mug', 'red cup',  'yellow box', 'red apple', 'orange', 
  'yellow bottle', 'banaba', 'yellow spoon', 'red tomato', 'hammer', 'plate']


2. According to the [question] and your last answer, please choose the correct object you want to grasp, and the target position to place this object:


3. If you do not need to do any manipulation, because the question does not ask to manipulate, or you need more information.
for example, you cannot pick this object.

output: 

{'object': None,
'grasp': False,
'target': None}

4. If you cannot make sure which object to grasp, or if you cannot grasp it.
for example, your answer is 'I cannot grasp that plate', or 'I can pick the red mug or the blue mug for you to drink. Which one do you prefer?'
Then the grasp should be False

output:
{'object': 'None',
'grasp': False,
'target': None}


4. For example, your answer is "I will pick the mug"

Output:

{'object': 'purple mug',
'grasp': True,
 'target': None}

This means you want to pick the purple mug, but you just hold it, and no need to place it. So the target is None.

5. Another example, your answer is "I will pick the apple and put it to the mug".

Output:

{'object': 'apple',
'grasp': True,
 'target': 'purple mug'}

6. If the question ask you to give the object to the user, then you should use a new keywork 'handover'.
For example, the question is "Give this box to me". You answer is "I will pick the box and give it to you."
When saying 'give me', this means your target is 'handover'.

Output:

{'object': 'orange box',
'grasp': True,
'target': 'handover'}


7. Your answer should only has the dict {}. You should set 'grasp' to False,, unless your answer clearly specify one object to grasp.
